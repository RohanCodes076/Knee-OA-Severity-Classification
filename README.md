# 🦴 Knee Osteoarthritis Severity Classification using Deep Learning & Vision Transformers

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **automated classification of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) severity** using advanced deep learning techniques.
We integrate **CNN architectures** and **Vision Transformers (ViT)** to capture both **local features** and **global relationships** in X-ray images.
